:sparkles: Introducing...Logging FLASH CHALLENGE! :sparkles: 

Help us get an accurate snapshot of the network by participating in our Logging Challenge. Earn 500 points for each report submitted with logs exported during the two time periods below: 

:arrow_right: Period 1: Friday (12/18), 5-7am UTC 

:arrow_right: Period 2: Friday (12/18), 5-7pm UTC

Follow these steps for each of the periods:

1. Ensure that the node is running with -file-log-level INFO and is synced before the period starts. The latest documentation at https://minaprotocol.com/docs/connecting shows how to run a daemon with all of the proper flags.

2. Export logs using the following command at the end of the period for each node.

coda client export-local-logs

3. Email the generated tar file and your full Discord ID to [logs@o1labs.org] with the subject "Block Latency"

Points will be rewarded for each node that you submit logs for, and for each time period. You can earn unlimited points. :rocket: 

Points Examples

1 Node, Log for Either Period 1 or 2 = 500 points
1 Node, Logs for Both Periods 1 & 2= 1000 points
5 Nodes, Logs for Both Periods 1 & 2= 5000 points
etc...

Have fun, and as always, thanks for all you do! :purple_heart:
